Star Schema and Snowflake Schema are data warehouse design approaches.

A star schema has a central fact table connected to dimension tables, directly linking attributes to facts, simplifying queries and enhancing performance.

The snowflake schema, a variation of the star, further normalizes dimension tables into sub-dimension tables, reducing data redundancy but increasing complexity.

Star schemas are preferred for their simplicity and query efficiency, while snowflake schemas are chosen for their data integrity and storage efficiency.

---------------------------------
Star Schema:

Advantages:

- Simplicity: The design is easy to understand and implement.

- Performance: Queries are faster due to fewer joins.


Disadvantages:

Data Redundancy: Since it is not normalized, data may be duplicated multiple times.

Maintenance Challenges: Updating and synchronizing data becomes more complicated.

-------------------------------------

Snowflake Schema:

Advantages:

Normalization: Reduces data redundancy, making maintenance and updates easier.

Data Integrity: Data is better organized, ensuring integrity.


Disadvantages:

- Complexity: The design is more complex, making it harder to understand and implement.

- Performance: Queries are slower as more joins are required to retrieve complete data.
