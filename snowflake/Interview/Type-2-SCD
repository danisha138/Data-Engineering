Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2:

SCDs are a common database modeling technique used to capture data in a table and show how it changes over time.
Although SCDs are most commonly associated with dimensions.

SCD Type 2 is used to capture and manage both current and historical data changes effectively. Instead of updating existing records,
it creates new rows for each change in dimension attributes, maintaining multiple versions of records in the table 
where each version can be identified by a unique key and an effective date range.

It also enables accurate reporting and analysis of historical data while ensuring data warehouse integrity.
